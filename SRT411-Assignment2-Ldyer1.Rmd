#Assignment 2: Data Analysis at Home and on the Web
## Student:Lorraine Dyer
## Student Number: 014057111
##Date Due: Feb 23 2017


### The defined problem is as follows:
### Which models of hard drives are more likely to fail?

### Available Data:
###Statistics about Hard Drives from the years 2013 and 2016.


#Parsing Information - (See data below)


library(readr)
X2016_12_31 <- read_csv("~/Lorraine/Winter2017-Semester7/SRT411/Data_Sets/Test/data_Q4_2016/2016-12-31.csv",

#### Conclusions

##2016 - Drive Failure According to Hard Drive Model
###  + According to this bar graph the lower the alphabetical Hard Drive Model,
###  + has almost the same amount of failure as the higher alphabetical Hard Drive Model.

##2016 Drive failure according to Model Serial Number
###+ Drives with a serial number less than 20000 were less likely to fail.

##2013 Results - Model versus capacity of drive
###+It was determined that the lower the model serial number the lesser the capacity of the Hard Drive.
